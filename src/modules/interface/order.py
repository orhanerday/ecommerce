"""
This module serves as the interface layer for the products domain.

- Define only public-facing API routes or helper functions for crossâ€‘module communication here.
- Keep all business logic in service.py or dedicated builder classes within the build/ folder.
- This separation improves maintainability and enforces clear boundaries between modules.
- In the future, this module can evolve into an API gateway for communication between microservices.
